# Analytiks
A small interface to create your own analytics in a fast and easy way.
The API is created in the manner of the logging library [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) by Jake Wharton.
The inspiration for analytics handled in this way came from [this blog article](https://medium.com/@nadavfima/how-to-build-better-analytics-with-kotlin-60ab50ce25ac) by Nadav Fima. GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/sofakingforever/solid-kotlin-analytics)
